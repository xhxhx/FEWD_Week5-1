We want a simple application that has four different buttons. Each button will either add or subtract an amount from a total. The total is updated and displayed below the buttons.

We are starting to use `<button>` elements. We will look more closely at forms in Week 8.

Let's look up the methods at <https://api.jquery.com/> as we go along

We will need to do the following:

* write a function for each addition or subtraction
* keep the total in a variable in our JavaScript, which is defined *outside* of the functions
* update the total in each function
* update the displayed amount in each function

* use the jQuery `html()` method to update the value of an html element
* use the jQuery `click()` method to bind our function to the `<button>` on the page
